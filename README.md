<p style="text-align: justify;">The project is the final project of the course Business Process Modelling. We developed a Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) and Workflow Net analysis of a structured process scenario set in the context of a dance school. The objective of this project is to design a process that models how the dance school manages student requests, lesson scheduling, and interactions between students and instructors, and to analyze the correctness of the resulting model. 
<br> The main factors involved in the process are: Student, School and Instructor. First, a BPMN diagram was created to visually describe the entire process. Next, the model was converted into a Workflow Net represented in Petri Net notation. Finally, a semantic analysis was carried out using tools such as WoPeD and Woflan to evaluate the behavioral
properties of the Workflow Net, including soundness, deadlock-freeness, boundedness, and proper termination.</p>
